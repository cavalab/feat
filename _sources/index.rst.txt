Feature Engineering Automation Tool
===================================

**FEAT** is a feature engineering automation tool that learns new
representations of raw data to improve classifier and regressor
performance. The underlying methods use Pareto optimization and
evolutionary computation to search the space of possible
transformations.

FEAT wraps around a user-chosen ML method and provides a set of
representations that give the best performance for that method. Each
individual in FEATâ€™s population is its own data representation.
